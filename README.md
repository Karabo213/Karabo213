 the covid-19 pandemic amongst other things highlighted how south African citizens participate less in anything 
 that has to do with Judiciary system.As a result of this most people say they are never consulted before new Acts 
 and ammendments in the Judiciary system come to practice.

   Stream cases live at SA Judiciary channel from youtube
   subscribe to receive petitions
   Ability to ask questions about certain case
